You have found the code base for Php On Rails (kinda) Generator aka PORK.Generator

If you download and run this project, you will see a list of all the databases in your connected MySql database. You can explore all the connections in the tables. If you have set up your database using primary auto increment keys and use these keys througout your database for links, it will recognize what type of relation you mean (1:1, many:1, 1:many, many:many) and you can instantly create classes and plugins for cut-n-paste, or download an entire CRUD backend application zipped up and ready to deploy.

There is also a feature that generates a GraphViz representation of your database.
